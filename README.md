# Oolong
## A comfy color theme for your 5PM coding needs

This theme is a work in progress : Throughout the year, it is bound to mutate according to my tastes and needs. Hopefully, it will reach some form of stability ?

At the moment :
- Some starting, almost mockup colors are available
- No coloring is done on the UI elements
- I am still going through the tm tags trying to understand how they work. The colorscheme might thus work better for C++ code.
